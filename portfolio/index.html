                The very first hackathon I went to!
                Working with unity, introduced me to the overlap between coding and design.
                We came third and I had a lot of fun - the first time I thought seriously about a future in software development.

                Prototype of Bottle Sorting Machine
                Working in teams of 3, for one of our courses, we were to build a proof-of-concept bottle sorting robot from scratch. 
                Learned about the importance of teamwork, cooperation, and friendship, even when we came across hard times. 
                Successfully was able to build a robot that sorted with 90% accuracy at demo and came 4th in the grade based on set criteria.

                My Personal Website
                I made this website because I had seen other people with really cool aesthetic websites and wanted to try making one for myself. 
                I've always been interested in art and design (although I'm not great at it), and wanted to combine that with coding. 
                My website is heavily inspired by indie games I used to play. Everything is self drawn! 
                I'm still looking to improve my website - one major problem I'm encountering is mobile adaptation while still maintaining the "game" feel.

                Developing a Website Mockup for the Engineering Science Basketball Team
                Many of my friends were on the Engineering Science Basketball Team, and I took inspiration from that to try to create a fun mockup of a new website. 
                I wanted to make something that was a bit quirky and interactive.

                Another attempt of creating a scraper and then trying to use concepts of cleaning and manipulating data to create a local database with all Anime.
                I'm still working on this, now that I have improved statistical knowledge in order to develop trends from the collected dataset!

                Using Regression Analysis to Analyze Player Shooting Splits between NCAA and NBA
                Combining my love of basketball and my desire to use the statistics I learned in a practical project, I decided to tackle the truthfulness
                of a common saying in basketball circles - that college free throw shooting is the best metric of NBA shooting.
