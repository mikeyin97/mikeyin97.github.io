                <p> Welcome to my website! I'm a second year engineering science student currently studying at the University of Toronto. I'm a late bloomer in terms of coding, as I only started picking up programming in university. Since then, however, I've been coding non-stop! I love participating in design competitions and hackathons, designing and creating small electrical projects, and working on personal programming projects. Some of my main technical interests include UI design, back-end programming, machine learning, and robotics. 

                <p>In the (little) leisure time that I do have, I also enjoy playing sports, playing video games, snuggling with my cats, watching anime, and reading.</p>

                        <h4>Researcher, May 2016 to August 2016</h4>
                        <p> During the summer, I worked at the <i>Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Laboratory</i> at the University of Toronto. In collaboration with a startup called MyAbilities Inc., we performed research and proof-of-concept development of a wearable biomedical device for injury and performance testing.</p>
                        <p> Some of my responsibilities were to
                        <ul><li>Collect and analyze research data in real-time using various frequency processing and machine learning algorithms, written primarily in Arduino, Python, and MATLAB. </li>
                            <li>Store motion sensor data in both xml format as well as on a local server  using node.js</li>
                            <li>Help animate a 3D model of the human head and torso on a web browser using this stored data. This was done using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. </li></ul></p>

                    <p> I created an AI for Pong. This AI automatically determines and reacts to the trajectory of the ball based on a series of calculations involving angles and distances. The AI also creates a slight spin as an added challenge to the player.</p>
